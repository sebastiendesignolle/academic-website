I'm Sébastien Designolle, an INRIA researcher (ISFP) of the QINFO team in Lyon since July 2025.
Before that, I was a post-doc at the Zuse Institute Berlin, where I was essentially in a team working in continuous optimisation.
I obtained my PhD at the University of Geneva in 2021, mostly working on incompatibility of quantum measurements, semidefinite programming (SDP), and quantum systems of high although finite dimensions.
I'm fascinated by symmetric structures arising in real and complex spaces and often try to use them as a first step when exploring the blossoming confusion emerging as soon as we go beyond qubits.
